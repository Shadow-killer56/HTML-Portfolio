<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Scott Dabrowski. I am a Web Developer in training, currently learning by progressing through both Colt
  Steele and Angela Yu's courses on Udemy.</p>

<p>I originally learned Web Development in College in the years 2009 - 2011. Skills I learned during my time in College
  are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. Because of the length of time since I learned these skills, I had either
  forgotten a lot about them, or what knowledge I retained was outdated. </p>

<p>However, I was unfortunately unable to get a job in the field of Web Development (mostly due to lack of projects or
  websites to show). After falling into a bit of a slump for 10 or so years, I decided to relearn with the hope of
  becoming a Web Developer.</p>
